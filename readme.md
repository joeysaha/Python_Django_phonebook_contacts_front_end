##Contacts

#Getting started
1. Install dependencies
2. Boot up app with 'python3 manage.py runserver'
3. Access http://localhost:8000/contacts/person/


App shows user's contact list and can go in depth to the individual contact page. 

Javascript pulls data from a Django backend.



#Known bugs:
The CORS Chrome plugin is required.  I tried several ways to circumvent the issue but nothing else worked aside from using a Chrome plugin to view the data.
Note - it's dangerous and ill-advised to use.

Post doesn't work due to 415 unsupported media type error.

Styling and appearance will be done when there is more time.
